## 7. ü§ñ AUTOMATED ENFORCEMENT

### GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/pr-tests.yml`)
- Runs on EVERY pull request
- ALL 7 test suites must pass
- Cannot be skipped or bypassed

### Branch Protection Rules
```yaml
develop:
  - Require pull request reviews: 1
  - Require status checks to pass
  - Require branches to be up to date
  - Include administrators
  - Restrict force pushes

staging:
  - Require pull request reviews: 1
  - Must be ahead of develop
  - All tests must pass

production:
  - Require pull request reviews: 2
  - Must be ahead of staging
  - All tests must pass
  - Restrict who can merge
```

### Git Hooks (Husky)
- **pre-commit**: Checks for secrets and console.logs
- **pre-push**: Runs tests based on target branch

## 8. üö® VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES

Violations of these rules will result in:
1. **Immediate PR rejection**
2. **Automated rollback** if somehow merged
3. **Audit log entry** for compliance
4. **Required retrospective** for process improvement

## 9. üìù COMMIT MESSAGE FORMAT

All commits MUST follow this format:
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

## 10. üéØ USE CASE BASED DEVELOPMENT

- **EVERY** feature must have a Use Case ID (UC###)
- **EVERY** UC must have tests BEFORE implementation
- **EVERY** PR title must include the UC###

## ENFORCEMENT CHECKLIST

- [ ] PR created (not direct commit)
- [ ] All 7 test suites passing
- [ ] No console.log statements
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] UC### referenced in PR
- [ ] Documentation updated
